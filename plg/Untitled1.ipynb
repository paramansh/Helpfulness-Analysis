Some editor should have told him that in a mystery, something has to happen. The plot has to move.  We got the murder right up front but two discs and two hours of listening later, all we know is that the victim was a chess player and heroin addict named Frank.  I couldn't stand it.

Bach and the \\\\\"progressive\\\\\" Frederick the Great. Of course, classic interpretations of both men (the conservative composer vs. the first-ever \\'enlightened\\' ruler) break down under the demonstrable complexity of their respective characters, and in the end Gaines clearly and cleverly reveals the counterpoints apparent in each: the avant garde, even radically political elements in Bach\\'s music and the traditional, tried-and-true despotism employed by Frederick. Bach and Frederick, in other words, each contained aspects of traditional and the modern, as well as \\'ratio\\' and \\'sensus\\' (reason and faith, for Gaines)--but in differing proportions according to their station and their art. They were each of them perfect examples, and living contradictions, of the age they helped to define, and has since defined them.To hinge, if only for a few hundred pages, essential elements of the Enlightenment on one musical composition (Bach\\'s Musical Offering), is to reveal a jewel hidden in the historically messy pile that is the \\\\\"age of reason.\\\\\" Bravo.\\n'"
